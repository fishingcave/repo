### 观自在菩萨，行深 般若波罗蜜多 时 照 见 五蕴 皆 空，度 一切苦厄。
#### When Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva was practicing the profound Prajñāpāramitā, he illuminated the Five Skandhas and saw that they were all empty, and crossed over all suffering and affliction.

### 舍利子，色 不异 空，空 不异 色，色 即 是 空，空 即 是 色，受想行识亦复如是。
#### “Śāriputra, form is not different from emptiness, and emptiness is not different from form. Form itself is emptiness, and emptiness itself is form. Sensation, conception, synthesis, and discrimination are also such as this.

#### 舍利子，是 诸法 
##### 空相，
###### 不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。是 故 
####### 空中无色，无受想行识，无 眼耳鼻舌身意，无 色声香味触法，
######## 无眼界 乃至 无意识界，无无明 亦无 无明尽，乃至 无老死，亦无 老死尽，无苦集灭道，无智亦无得。
######### Śāriputra, all dharmas are empty: they are neither created nor destroyed, neither defiled nor pure, and they neither increase nor diminish. This is because in emptiness there is no form, sensation, conception, synthesis, or discrimination. There are no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or thoughts. There are no forms, sounds, scents, tastes, sensations, or dharmas. 

######### There is no field of vision and there is no realm of thoughts. There is no ignorance nor elimination of ignorance, even up to and including no old age and death, nor elimination of old age and death. There is no suffering, its accumulation, its elimination, or a path. There is no understanding and no attaining.

### 以 无所得 故 菩提萨埵 依 般若波罗蜜多 故 心 无挂碍; 无挂碍 故 无有恐怖，远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃。
#### “Because there is no attainment, bodhisattvas rely on Prajñāpāramitā, and their minds have no obstructions. Since there are no obstructions, they have no fears. Because they are detached from backwards dream-thinking, their final result is Nirvāṇa.

### 三世诸佛，依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。
#### Because all buddhas of the past, present, and future rely on Prajñāpāramitā, they attain Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi.

### 故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。故说般若波罗蜜多咒，
#### Therefore, know that Prajñāpāramitā is a great spiritual mantra, a great brilliant mantra, an unsurpassed mantra, and an unequalled mantra. The Prajñāpāramitā Mantra is spoken because it can truly remove all afflictions.

### 即说咒曰：揭谛揭谛，波罗揭谛，波罗僧揭谛，菩提萨婆诃。
#### The mantra is spoken thusly:

#### gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā
